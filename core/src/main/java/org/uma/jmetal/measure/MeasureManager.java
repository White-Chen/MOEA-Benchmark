/**
 * A {@link MeasureManager} aims at managing a set of {@link Measure}s.
 * Typically, a {@link Measurable} entity would create a single
 * {@link MeasureManager} to store all the {@link Measure}s it would like to
 * support, each of them being identified by a key.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * Because a {@link Measure} can be whether a {@link PullMeasure} or a
 * {@link PushMeasure}, the two methods {@link #getPullMeasure(Object)} and
 * {@link #getPushMeasure(Object)} are provided. It could be that a single
 * {@link Measure} is also available through both (via a single instance
 * implementing both interfaces or two different instances implementing each
 * interface), leading to have both methods returning a non-<code>null</code>
 * value for the same key.
